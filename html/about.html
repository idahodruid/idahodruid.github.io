               Topics of interest: EXPAND ON THESES

               I’ve always had a huge interest in becoming a software developer but my main focus has primarily been game development.
               I love the idea of making games because of how many parts there are, art, music, and development, etc.
               The inherent design of game development brings people together and many of my best friends have come from communities that have a passion for playing or developing games. This is why I feel like eventually,
               I would really like a career in game dev or tech related to it.  I started experimenting with Unity in high school, but I quickly learned that my coding skills at that time were not good enough.
               I started working on C++ on my own for about a year before starting at ISU.
            </p>
            <p>
               Since then I have made quite a few games for class projects and on my own time which include Monopoly in Java, Pong using raylib in C++, a console game using ASCII in C++, an FPS made using C++ and Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5, and most recently, a retro-style tank game made in C++ and QT.
               All of these can be found on my projects page.
               &nbsp;
               Current interests/projects:
               &nbsp;
               Inverse kinematics:
               Inverse kinematics is related to algorithmic solutions for animations and some robotics applications. Procedurl animation is similar to regular animation but has infinite variations depending on the scenario.
               I am currently working on implementing and learning some inverse kinematics to strengthen my games and give them much more personality.
               &nbsp;
               DLSS: I have a large interest in DLSS and graphics card architechture. Fully AI generated frames in real time rendering is something i am planning on exploring more in the future.
